Generate a plot of the sun's position in the sky over the year.

The y-axis represents time of day, running from 00:00 at the top to 23:59 at the bottom.

The x-axis represents day of the year, running from Jan. 1 on the left to Dec. 31 on the right.

A pixel's lightness corresponds to the sun's altitude (angular height in the sky) at that time, with white being straight overhead and black being directly underfoot.

A pixel's hue corresponds to the sun's azimuth (angle North, East, South, or West) at that time.
